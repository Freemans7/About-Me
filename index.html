        <h4>A Little About Myself</h4>
        <p>As a child we moved about 10 times by the time I was ten.<br>
        I then grew up on the family farm from my mom's side.  I have<br>
        lived in Iowa since.  If I take over the farm someday it will<br>
        be a fourth generation family farm.  I hope to raise livestock<br>
        as well on the side besides being a software developer.  The<br>
        farm is organic and I would like to keep it that way.  I would<br>
        also like to seriously consider organic grass fed livestock.
        </p>

        <p>
            I plan to learn other coding languages after I learn <br>
            JavaScript.  I'm not sure yet were I would like to go<br>
            from there language wise after that.  I may continue <br>
            on learning Python or I may start another language <br>
            entirely. I'm no where near proficient in it yet, but <br>
            I do have a good start on it.
